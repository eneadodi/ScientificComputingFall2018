    "### Yes the code is easy to follow. There is two functions, fucntion erestinas (eratosthenes) which outputs prime numbers until the input integer. THe second function is a generator which outputs the next prime every time. \n",

    "### of course \n",
    "## Do you see any suggestions for how to improve the code? Are the test cases in the test module run by the code automatically by Travis? Do the tests verify correct functionality? On a scale of 0-100, the reviewer should rate the work produced by the reviewee. "
